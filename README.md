# REACT TIC-TAC-TOE


**This game  was built using React.js**


**All things considered, tic tac toe is a well-known, straightforward game that has maintained its appeal throughout time because of its basic rules and opportunity for both instructional and recreational use. The tic tac toe game has the following features:**


Game Board: The game board is a 3 by 3 grid on which the game is played. An "X" or "O" symbol may occupy a cell, or each cell may be left empty.



Player Turns: The game is played by two players in turn. Typically, one player represents "X," while the other plays as "O." "X" always makes the opening move in the game.


Symbols: The player's moves are indicated on the grid by the symbols "X" and "O," which are commonly used throughout the game.

Winning Lines: The goal is to arrange three of your symbols in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. A player wins the game when they are able to build one of these lines.

Move Validations: Only empty cells are allowed for players to insert their symbols. A player must select a new move if they attempt to perform an illegal move (such as inserting a symbol outside the grid or within an occupied cell).

Draw Condition: The game is a draw if every cell is filled and no winning line has been constructed by either player.

Interface: These days, tic tac toe can be played on a variety of platforms, such as real boards, paper and pencil, and electronic devices (computers, cellphones, tablets). Players can interact with each other using touch or mouse inputs, and user interfaces frequently feature graphical representations of the game board.

Playing the game against a computer AI opponent or with two human players is possible in both multiplayer and singleplayer modes.

Although the game is straightforward, players can use techniques to increase their chances of winning or forcing a tie. Competent players can set up traps or obstruct their opponents' movements with strategies.

Educational Value: Tic tac toe is frequently used as a teaching tool to help young children learn reasoning, problem-solving skills, and strategic thinking.

Limitations: Tic tac toe has a limited number of moves due to its small grid size and straightforward rules, which results in its signature of always finishing in a draw with flawless play from both sides.
